Logical Circuit Introduction

A logic circuit is composed of:
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Functional specification
- Timing specification

- Nodes
- Circuit elements


# Rules of Combinational Logic

- Every element is combinational
- Every node is either an input or connects to exactly one output  -> And can be connected to multiple input of other elements!!!
- The circuit contains no cyclic paths (acyclic)

- Ex)
  A,B,C, A', B', C' != 2^6

Literal : variable or its complement
Implicant : product of literals
Minterm: product that includes all input variables
ex) ABC,A'BC,A'B'C
Maxterm : sum that includes all input variables
ex) (A+B+C), (A'+B+C), (A,B',C')




A   B                      | f
------------------------------------
0    0                     | 0
0    1                     | 1
1    0                     | 0
1    1                     | 1

minterm ==
A' x B'   m0
A' x B    m1
A  x B'   m2
A  x B    m3

f= m1+m3  (OR)
